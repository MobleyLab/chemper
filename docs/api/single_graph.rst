SingleGraph
============

``SingleGraph``s convert a molecule into a SMIRKS pattern by
converting information about the atoms and bonds.
The ``SingleGraph`` stores only one molecule. It can convert only certain atoms or
the *entire* molecule into a SMIRKS pattern.
This direction of molecule to SMIRKS string is new as far as the authors know with chemper.
